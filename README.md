# Weird esoteric cat emoji programming language
*Or: what am I doing with my life*

Check out hello.cats for hello world and hello.cats.meow for compiled version. Can be downloaded as jar and then used to generate and run code. This language is great, because you can comment everywhere.

.cats - not compiled

.cats.meow - compiled

## Challenge
Open issues with your own code in this language. Best submissions will be added in README.
